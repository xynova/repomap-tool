### 🔄 **REMAINING CRITICAL TASKS**

## 🎯 **CRITICAL PRIORITY 1: Tree Building Implementation**

**Status**: 🔴 **PENDING**  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL**  
**Location**: `src/repomap_tool/core/repo_map.py:889`

### Issue Description
The tree building functionality is incomplete and lacks dependency intelligence. This affects the core exploration features of the tool.

### Current State
```python
# Line 889 in repo_map.py
def build_exploration_tree(self, entrypoints: List[Entrypoint]) -> ExplorationTree:
    # TODO: Implement full tree building with dependency intelligence
    # Currently returns basic structure without real dependency analysis
```

### Required Implementation
- **Dependency Intelligence**: Use actual dependency graph for tree construction
- **Smart Node Selection**: Prioritize nodes based on centrality and importance
- **Depth Management**: Implement intelligent depth limiting based on complexity
- **Context Awareness**: Include file relationships and call patterns in tree structure

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Tree building uses real dependency analysis
- [ ] Nodes are intelligently selected based on importance metrics
- [ ] Tree depth is managed based on complexity analysis
- [ ] Integration with centrality calculator for node prioritization
- [ ] Comprehensive tests for tree building scenarios

## 🎯 **CRITICAL PRIORITY 2: Performance Optimization**

**Status**: 🔴 **PENDING**  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL**  
**Impact**: High - affects scalability and user experience

### 2.1 Loop Optimization
**Location**: Multiple files with 922 loop instances  
**Issue**: O(n³) complexity in nested loops affecting performance

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Identify and optimize nested loop structures
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated calculations
- [ ] Use vectorized operations where possible
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics

### 2.2 Regex Optimization
**Location**: Multiple files with 502 regex operations  
**Issue**: Uncompiled regex patterns causing performance bottlenecks

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Compile all regex patterns at module level
- [ ] Cache compiled patterns for reuse
- [ ] Optimize regex patterns for better performance
- [ ] Add regex performance monitoring

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Loop complexity reduced from O(n³) to O(n²) or better
- [ ] All regex patterns compiled and cached
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show 50%+ improvement
- [ ] Memory usage optimized and bounded

## 🎯 **CRITICAL PRIORITY 3: Architecture Refactoring**

**Status**: 🔴 **PENDING**  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL**  
**Impact**: High - affects maintainability and extensibility

### 3.1 God Class Breakdown
**Location**: `src/repomap_tool/dependencies/llm_file_analyzer.py` (1251 lines)  
**Issue**: Single class handling too many responsibilities

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Break down into focused modules:
  - `CentralityAnalyzer` - Centrality calculations and analysis
  - `DependencyAnalyzer` - Dependency relationship analysis
  - `FunctionCallAnalyzer` - Function call pattern analysis
  - `OutputFormatter` - LLM-optimized output formatting
- [ ] Implement proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Update all dependent code

### 3.2 Coupling Reduction
**Location**: 45 files with 1457 imports  
**Issue**: Tight coupling between modules affecting testability

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Implement dependency injection patterns
- [ ] Create clear interfaces and protocols
- [ ] Reduce circular dependencies
- [ ] Improve module independence

### Success Criteria
- [ ] LLMFileAnalyzer broken into 4+ focused classes (<300 lines each)
- [ ] Import count reduced by 30%+
- [ ] All modules can be tested independently
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns achieved

## 🎯 **CRITICAL PRIORITY 4: File System Validation**

**Status**: 🔴 **PENDING**  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL**  
**Impact**: Medium - affects reliability and security

### Issue Description
91 file system operations lack proper validation, creating potential security and reliability issues.

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Add path validation for all file operations
- [ ] Implement safe file access patterns
- [ ] Add file size and type validation
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for file operations
- [ ] Add security checks for file paths

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All file operations have proper validation
- [ ] Path injection vulnerabilities eliminated
- [ ] File access errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Security audit passes for file operations
