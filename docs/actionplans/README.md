# RepoMap-Tool Action Plans

This directory contains comprehensive action plans for transforming repomap-tool into a best-in-class development companion that matches and exceeds aider's repomap functionality.

## Overview

The transformation is organized into phases over 8-12 weeks, targeting specific functionality gaps:

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Impact | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| **[Phase 1](phase1-tree-exploration.md)** | Tree-Based Exploration | 2-3 weeks | Critical | üìã Planned |
| **[Phase 1B](phase1-context-awareness.md)** | Context Awareness (Optional) | 1-2 weeks | Medium | üìã Planned |
| **[Phase 2](phase2-dependency-analysis.md)** | Dependency Analysis | 3-4 weeks | High | üìã Planned |
| **[Phase 3](phase3-llm-optimization.md)** | LLM Optimization | 1-2 weeks | Medium | üìã Planned |
| **[Phase 4](phase4-realtime-integration.md)** | Real-time Integration | 2-3 weeks | Medium-High | üìã Planned |

## Quick Start

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Start with Phase 1** - Tree exploration is the core tool functionality
2. **Review dependencies** - Each phase builds on previous phases
3. **Set up development environment** - Ensure all required tools are available
4. **Begin implementation** - Follow the detailed day-by-day plans

```

## Phase Descriptions

### Phase 1: Tree-Based Exploration ‚≠ê **CORE FUNCTIONALITY**
**The Main Tool** - Implements the fundamental tree-based code exploration workflow.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Smart entrypoint discovery (using existing semantic/fuzzy matching)
- Tree building and clustering by context
- Tree manipulation (focus, expand, prune)
- Session management (external control)
- Tree-focused repomap generation

**Why Start Here:** This IS the tool - everything else enhances this core workflow.

### Phase 1B: Collaborative Context Awareness (Optional Enhancement)
**LLM Partnership** - Adds collaborative semantic augmentation layer on top of tree exploration.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Exploration point identification for LLM augmentation
- LLM semantic enhancement of tree nodes
- Context-enhanced mapping with LLM insights
- LLM-guided expansion suggestions

**Why Optional:** Enhances tree exploration but not required for core functionality.

### Phase 2: Dependency Analysis
**Intelligence Layer** - Enhances tree building with comprehensive code relationship understanding.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete dependency graph analysis
- File importance ranking based on connectivity
- Impact analysis for change assessment
- Enhanced tree building with dependency intelligence

**Why Important:** Makes tree discovery and building much more intelligent.

### Phase 3: LLM Optimization
**Output Efficiency** - Optimizes tree map output specifically for LLM consumption.

**Key Deliverables:**
- LLM-optimized hierarchical output format
- Critical code line extraction
- Token-efficient representation
- Enhanced type signatures and call patterns

**Why Important:** Maximizes value within LLM context window limitations.

### Phase 4: Real-time Integration
**Workflow Integration** - Enables seamless integration into development workflows.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Real-time session management
- IDE plugin integrations (VS Code, Cursor)
- Webhook support for external tools
- Live repomap updates during development

**Why Valuable:** Transforms tool from standalone utility into integrated development companion.

## Current Gap Analysis

### ‚úÖ What We Already Have (Strong Foundation)
- Aider's RepoMap class integration
- Multi-language symbol extraction (ctags/tree-sitter)
- Fuzzy and semantic matching (advantage over aider)
- Docker containerization and API server
- Parallel processing and caching

### ‚ùå What's Missing (~30% functionality gap)
- **Tree-Based Exploration** - No structured exploration workflow (Phase 1)
- **Dependency Analysis** - No code relationship understanding (Phase 2)
- **LLM Optimization** - Generic output not optimized for LLM consumption (Phase 3)
- **Real-time Integration** - No seamless workflow integration (Phase 4)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles
1. **Tree Exploration First** - Phase 1 delivers the core tool functionality
2. **Incremental Enhancement** - Each phase builds valuable functionality on top
3. **External Session Control** - Sessions managed via CLI params/env vars
4. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure** - Use current semantic/fuzzy matching capabilities
5. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing functionality remains available

### Technical Standards
- **Code Quality** - Follow existing patterns and conventions
- **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation and helpful error messages
- **Configuration** - All features configurable via settings
- **Monitoring** - Performance metrics and health checks
- **Security** - Secure integrations and data handling

### Risk Mitigation
- **Start Simple** - Implement basic versions first, add complexity gradually
- **Continuous Testing** - Test with real codebases throughout development
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track impact on speed and memory usage
- **User Feedback** - Gather feedback early and often
- **Fallback Options** - Provide fallbacks when advanced features fail

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Primary Developer:** Full-time for 8-12 weeks
- **Supporting Developer:** Part-time for phases 2-4
- **Testing/QA:** Part-time throughout project

### Technical Requirements
- **Languages:** Python 3.8+, JavaScript/TypeScript for IDE extensions
- **Dependencies:** NetworkX, tree-sitter, websockets, various parsing libraries
- **Infrastructure:** Development environment with multiple IDEs for testing

### Testing Requirements
- **Multi-language Codebases:** For comprehensive testing
- **IDE Installations:** VS Code, Cursor for integration testing
- **Performance Testing:** Large codebases for scalability testing

## Alternative Approaches

### Accelerated Approach (6-8 weeks)
Focus on core features only, skip advanced functionality for faster delivery.

### Minimal Viable Product (4 weeks)  
Implement only Phase 1 (tree exploration) for quick value delivery.

### Enhanced Approach (12-16 weeks)
Add advanced features beyond aider parity for market differentiation.

## Getting Started

2. **Set Up Environment** - Install required dependencies and development tools
3. **Create Feature Branch** - Start with `feature/phase1-tree-exploration`
4. **Begin Day 1 Tasks** - Follow the detailed daily implementation plan

### Decision Points
