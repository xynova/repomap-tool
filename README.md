## Overview


**Why?** AI code assistants struggle with large codebases. They often miss context, can't find related code when names don't match exactly, and waste precious context window space searching for the right files. This leads to inaccurate suggestions and inefficient code generation.

**What?** RepoMap Tool is an intelligent code analysis engine that supercharges AI code assistants by providing comprehensive codebase understanding. It combines fuzzy matching (finding similar names) with semantic analysis (understanding meaning) to give AI assistants the context they need for accurate code suggestions.

**How?** It analyzes your codebase structure, maps relationships between files and functions, and provides AI assistants with intelligent search capabilities to discover and understand the code they need to work with effectively.

## The Problem

When AI code assistants work with large codebases, they face these critical challenges:

- **Context window limitations**: AI assistants waste precious tokens searching for relevant code
- **Naming variations**: AI can't find code when the same concept is named `userAuth`, `user_auth`, `UserAuth`, or `authenticate_user`
- **Scattered logic**: AI misses related functionality spread across multiple files with different naming conventions
- **Incomplete context**: AI generates suggestions without understanding the full codebase structure
- **Inefficient searches**: AI spends time on irrelevant files instead of focusing on the most relevant code

## The Solution

RepoMap Tool addresses these AI assistant challenges through:

### üîç **Fuzzy Matching**
Enables AI assistants to find code even when names don't match exactly:
- `userAuth` ‚Üî `user_auth` ‚Üî `UserAuth`
- `dataProcessor` ‚Üî `process_data` ‚Üî `DataProcessor`
- Handles typos, abbreviations, and naming conventions that confuse AI

### üß† **Semantic Analysis**
Gives AI assistants understanding of what code does, not just what it's called:
- AI can find authentication logic even if it's named `login`, `signin`, or `verify_credentials`
- AI discovers data processing functions regardless of naming patterns
- AI identifies related functionality across different modules

### ‚ö° **Hybrid Approach**
Provides AI assistants with comprehensive search capabilities through parallel analysis:

```

- **Parallel processing**: Both fuzzy and semantic analysis run simultaneously
- **Score combination**: Results are intelligently merged for optimal coverage
- **Weighted ranking**: Balances string similarity with conceptual understanding
- **Context-aware**: Adapts to your specific codebase patterns

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: AI Assistant Finding Authentication Code
**AI needs to understand**: "How does user authentication work in this codebase?"
**Without RepoMap**: AI might miss `login`, `signin`, or `verify_credentials` functions
**With RepoMap**: AI discovers all authentication-related code regardless of naming conventions

### Scenario 2: AI Assistant Understanding Data Flow
**AI needs to understand**: "How does data get processed in this application?"
**Without RepoMap**: AI might only see files with "process" in the name
**With RepoMap**: AI gets a comprehensive view of the entire data pipeline

### Scenario 3: AI Assistant Planning Refactoring
**AI needs to understand**: "What code would be affected if I change the user model?"
**Without RepoMap**: AI might miss hidden dependencies and cause breaking changes
**With RepoMap**: AI can analyze all relationships and dependencies automatically

## Getting Started

### Quick Start with Docker
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd repomap-tool

# Build and run with Docker
make docker-build
make docker-run

# Analyze your project (with cache persistence)
docker run -v $(pwd)/.repomap:/app/cache -v /path/to/your/project:/workspace repomap-tool analyze /workspace

# Search for code (with cache persistence)
docker run -v $(pwd)/.repomap:/app/cache -v /path/to/your/project:/workspace repomap-tool search /workspace "user authentication"
```

### Basic Usage Examples

**Find authentication-related code:**
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/.repomap:/app/cache -v /path/to/your/project:/workspace repomap-tool search /workspace "user login authentication"
```

**Discover data processing functions:**
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/.repomap:/app/cache -v /path/to/your/project:/workspace repomap-tool search /workspace "data processing pipeline" --match-type semantic
```

**Find code with similar names:**
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/.repomap:/app/cache -v /path/to/your/project:/workspace repomap-tool search /workspace "userAuth" --match-type fuzzy
```

**Get comprehensive results:**
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/.repomap:/app/cache -v /path/to/your/project:/workspace repomap-tool search /workspace "error handling" --match-type hybrid
```

## When to Use RepoMap Tool

### Perfect for:
- **Large codebases** (100+ files)
- **Legacy systems** with inconsistent naming
- **Team projects** where naming conventions vary
- **Code exploration** and understanding
- **Refactoring preparation** and impact analysis
- **Onboarding** new developers to existing codebases

### Use Cases:
- **"How does this feature work?"** - Understand implementation details
- **"Where is this functionality?"** - Find specific code quickly
- **"What would break if I change this?"** - Analyze dependencies
- **"Is there similar code elsewhere?"** - Find duplicates or alternatives
- **"How is data flowing through this system?"** - Map data pipelines

## Search Strategies

### Fuzzy Matching
Best for finding code when you know part of the name or there are naming variations.

**Example**: Searching for "userAuth" will find:
- `userAuth`
- `user_auth`
- `UserAuth`
- `authenticateUser`
- `userAuthentication`

### Semantic Matching
Best for finding code based on what it does, regardless of naming.

**Example**: Searching for "user authentication" will find:
- Functions that handle login/logout
- Password validation code
- Session management
- Authorization checks
- Security-related utilities

### Hybrid Matching
Best for comprehensive results that combine both approaches.

**Example**: Searching for "data processing" will find:
- Functions with "process" in the name (fuzzy)
- Functions that transform or manipulate data (semantic)
- Related utilities and helpers
- Pipeline components

## Project Analysis

RepoMap Tool doesn't just search - it analyzes your entire codebase to understand:

- **File relationships**: Which files import or depend on others
- **Function connections**: How functions call each other
- **Data flow**: How data moves through your application
- **Code complexity**: Which parts are most complex or tightly coupled
- **Architecture patterns**: How your code is organized

This analysis enables more intelligent searching and provides insights into your codebase structure.
